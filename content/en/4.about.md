A few words about me

#intro
I’m a passionate and detail-driven Programmer Analyst and Computer Science graduate with a creative edge. With a foundation in system servicing (NC2 Certified) and a sharp eye for visual design, I bridge logic and aesthetics to craft digital experiences that not only function flawlessly but also captivate. As a developer, art director, and photographer, I fuse technical depth with artistic intuition—bringing life to ideas that engage, inspire, and convert.
